Octo REST PHP
==

This code exists because I needed a way to share data for other my applications and I didn't found a way to do that in an easy way

I will use this code in a domain where it contains only this code and the data to share so probability it needs some edits
before it could be used in a more "advanced" environment.

Not sure why I decided to use "Octo" in the name.

The documentation is in Italian (lol). Usually I share this kind of code (useless for others but not for me maybe) in Bitbucket
but today I decided to post it here.

How to use
==

I clone the repository and start creating my API from the existing code (editing routes_v1.php file and creating new controllers).
